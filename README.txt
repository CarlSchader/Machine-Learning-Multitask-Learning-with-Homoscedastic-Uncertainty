This file contains everything I used to build multitask nets with log loss functions that use homoscedastic uncertainty with synthetic data. The args control the distributions of the synthetic data.

I did not include all the other stuff from our actual research directory because some of it I'm not sure my partner would be okay with. However, train.py contains a recent attempt at the vision network. It isn't working right now since we have added some things. It uses the CityScapes dataset.
